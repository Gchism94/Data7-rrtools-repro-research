### Level

Intermediate

### Prerequisites:

Familiarity with Version Control through RStudio and rmarkdown.


### System Requirements:

Pandoc (>= 1.17.2)
LaTeX

If you don't have LaTeX installed, consider installing `TinyTeX`, a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is small in size but functions well in most cases, especially for R users. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Check [docs](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) before before installing.
