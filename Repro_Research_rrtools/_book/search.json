Chism\n\n\n\nCreate Compendium\nNow we’re ready to create our compendium. We use rrtools::use_compendium() and supply it with a path for our new compendium. The final part of our path becomes the compendium name. Because the function effectively creates a package, only a single string of lowercase alpha characters is accepted as a name. Let’s use rrcompendium as the final part of our path.\nQuick tip: If you don’t know what path you’re currently in, you can check with the here package\n\nhere::here()\n\n[1] \"/Users/gregchism/Library/Documents/Desktop/rrtools-repro-research\"\nA way to short-hand this path is to say \"~/Desktop/rrtools-repro-research\", in which the ~ (tilde) is a shortcut for your home directory.\nTo create rrcompendium with a directory into your Desktop you can use:\n\nrrtools::use_compendium(\"~/Desktop/rrcompendium\")\n\nGo ahead and create a compendium at a location of your choice. Use the compendium name rrcompendium for ease of following the materials. If the call was successful you should see the following console output:\n✔ Setting active project to '~/Desktop/rrcompendium'\n✔ Creating 'R/'\n✔ Creating 'man/'\n✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'\n✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'\n✔ Writing 'rrcompendium.Rproj'\n✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'\n✔ Adding '^rrcompendium\\\\.Rproj$', '^\\\\.Rproj\\\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'\n✔ Opening new project 'rrcompendium' in RStudio\n✔ The package rrcompendium has been created\n✔ Opening the new compendium in a new RStudio session...\n\nNext, you need to:  ↓ ↓ ↓ \n● Edit the DESCRIPTION file\n● Use other 'rrtools' functions to add components to the compendium\nand a new Rstudio session launched for the compendium.\nPeriodically update Imports: in the DESCRIPTION with packages your compendium needs using rrtools::add_dependencies_to_description()\n\n\n\nInspect templates\n.\n├── DESCRIPTION <- .............................package metadata\n|                                               dependency management\n├── NAMESPACE <- ...............................AUTO-GENERATED on build\n├── R <- .......................................folder for functions\n├── man <- .....................................AUTO-GENERATED on build\n└── rrcompendium.Rproj <- ......................rstudio project file\nrrtools::use_compendium() creates the bare backbone of infrastructure required for a research compendium. At this point it provides facilities to store general metadata about our compendium (e.g., bibliographic details to create a citation) and manage dependencies in the DESCRIPTION file and store and document functions in the R/ folder (note that you will have to create this now).

    "section": "Document function",
    "text": "Document function\nDocumentation is one of the most important aspects of good, reproducible code. Roxygen2 provides a documentation framework in R.\n\n\nRoxygen2 documentation\nRoxygen2 allows us to write specially-structured comments preceding each function definition. These are processed automatically to produce .Rd help files for our functions and control which are exported to the package NAMESPACE.\nSee the Generating Rd files roxygen2 vignette or Karl Broman’s blog post on writing Roxygen2 documentation for further details.\n\n\n\nInsert Roxygen skeleton\nIn Rstudio, you can insert a Roxygen skeleton by placing the cursor anywhere in the definition of a function, then clicking:\nCode > Insert Roxygen Skeleton\nApplying this to our function results in this Roxygen skeleton:\n#' Title\n#'\n#' @param data\n#'\n#' @return\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @examples\ngroup_age <- function(data){\n  dplyr::mutate(data,\n                Age = ifelse(Age >= 21 & Age <= 30, \"Young\",\n                                   ifelse(Age > 30 & Age <=\n                                   50, \"Middle\",\n                                   \"Elderly\")),\n                Age = as.character(Age))\n\n\n\nComplete Roxygen documentation\nRoxygen comments start with #' so we can use regular comments for other purposes.\n\nTitle and description\nThe first line is the title of the function.\nThe title is followed by a blank #' line and then a longer description summarizing what the function does, which must be single paragraph.\nSo for our function we could write something like this:\n#' Group age variable\n#'\n#' Group age variable in dataframe containing data from file\n#' `diabetes.csv`\nFurther function details are documented in Roxygen using tags like @tag.\n\n\n\nFunction parameters (arguments)\n@param tags names are automatically extracted from the function for each function argument and document argument descriptions. We can document our single argument by editing the skeleton:\n#' @param data dataframe containing data from file\n#' `diabetes.csv`\n\n\n\nFunction output\nWe use tag @return to describe what the function returns:\n#' @return `data` with variable `Age` grouped for\n#' plotting\n\n\n\nExport function\n@export tells Roxygen2 to add this function as an export in the NAMESPACE file, so that it will be accessible available for use after package installation.\nThe Roxygen skeleton includes the @export tag by default. You can remove it for internal functions that will only be available within the NAMESPACE. You can access internal functions of a package using <package_name>:::\n\n\n\nProvide examples\nThe @examples tag provides executable R code showing how to use the function in practice. This is a very important part of the documentation because many people look at the examples before reading anything else.\nWe’ll skip this for now but come back to it a bit later. Remove the @examples tag for now.\nThe completed function documentation should look something like this:\n#' Group age variable\n#'\n#' Group age variable in dataframe containing data from file\n#' `diabetes.csv`\n#' @param data dataframe containing data from file\n#' `diabetes.csv`\n#' @return `data` with variable `Age` grouped for\n#' plotting\n#' @export\ngroup_age <- function(data){\n        mutate(data,\n                Age = ifelse(Age >= 21 & Age <= 30, \"Young\",\n                                   ifelse(Age > 30 & Age <= 50, \"Middle\",\n                                          \"Elderly\")),\n                Age = as.character(Age))\n}\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a renv::snapshot()!\n\nrenv::snapshot()"

You are free to put anything you like in inst/ with one caution: because inst/ is copied into the top-level directory, you should never use a sub-directory with the same name as an existing directory.\nThis means that you should generally avoid inst/build, inst/data, inst/demo, inst/exec, inst/help, inst/html, inst/inst, inst/libs, inst/Meta, inst/man, inst/po, inst/R, inst/src, inst/tests, inst/tools, and inst/vignettes.\n\n\nCreate inst/testdata/ directory\nLet’s create an inst/ directory and within it a testdata/ sub-directory to save our example data.\n\ndir.create(here::here(\"inst\", \"testdata\"), recursive = T)\n\n\n\n\nCopy example data\nNow let’s make a copy of diabetes.csv into the inst/testdata/ directory:\n\nfile.copy(from = here::here(\"analysis\", \"data\",\n                           \"raw_data\", \"diabetes.csv\"), \n          to = here::here(\"inst\", \"testdata\"))\n\nYou should now have an inst folder containing the following files\ninst\n└── testdata\n    └── diabetes.csv\n\n\n\nInstall\nRun 🔨 Install so that testdata/ is included in the build.\nWe can now use system.file(), which finds the full names of files in packages, in our test script to load our test data set.\nsystem.file(…, package = \"my_package\") \nIt uses anything supplied to … to build the path to the file, much like here::here().\nSo in test-process-data.R, we can now write:\n\ncontext(\"test-process-data\")\n\ndata <- readr::read_csv(system.file(\"testdata\",\n                                    \"gillespie.csv\",\n                                    package = \"rrcompendium\"))\n\nLet’s take a step back and make sure all of these package dependencies are in out DESCRIPTION.\n\nrrtools::add_dependencies_to_description()\n\nOur Imports should look like this:\nImports: \n    bookdown,\n    dplyr,\n    here,\n    knitr (>= 1.39),\n    pacman (>= 0.5.1),\n    readr (>= 2.1.2),\n    rmarkdown (>= 2.14)\nWe can also use this dataset to provide a working example of recode_system(data) in the function documentation. So let’s go back to R/process-data.R and add an example to our documentation\n#' @examples {\n#' data <- readr::read_csv(system.file(\"testdata\", \"diabetes.csv\",\n#' package = \"rrcompendium\"))\n#' recode_system_size(data)\n#' }\nDocument and the Install to update package.\n\n\n\n\nWrite test\nLet’s now write a couple of tests.\n\n\nTest grouping\nFirst let’s test that grouping works, by checking the unique values of Age after running group_age. Add the following to test-process-data.R:\n\ntest_that(\"grouping works\", {\n  expect_equal(unique(group_age(data)$Age),\n               c(\"Young\", \"Middle\", \"Elderly\"))\n})\n\n\n\n\nTest dimensions\nLet’s also test that the original dimensions of data are preserved after running our function. Add the following to test-process-data.R:\n\ntest_that(\"data dims preserved\", {\n    expect_equal(dim(group_age(data)),\n                 dim(data))\n})\n\nThe complete test-process-data.R file should look like this:\n\ndata <- readr::read_csv(system.file(\"testdata\",\n                                    \"diabetes.csv\",\n                                    package = \"rrcompendium\"))\n\ntest_that(\"grouping works\", {\n  expect_equal(unique(group_age(data)$Age),\n               c(\"Middle\", \"Young\", \"Elderly\"))\n})\n\ntest_that(\"data dims preserved\", {\n  expect_equal(dim(group_age(data)),\n               dim(data))\n})\n\nSince we are using read_csv from the readr package, if you didn’t use rrtools::add_dependencies_to_description() above, you will need to add readr to the dependencies.\n\nrrtools::add_dependencies_to_description()\n\nCheck that your Imports and Suggests in the DESCRIPTION looks like this:\nImports: \n    bookdown,\n    dplyr,\n    here,\n    knitr (>= 1.39),\n    pacman (>= 0.5.1),\n    readr (>= 2.1.2),\n    rmarkdown (>= 2.14)\nSuggests: \n    devtools,\n    git2r,\n    testthat (>= 3.0.0)\nOnce our tests are saved, we’re ready to test our package! 😃\n\n\n\n\nTest package\nWe can test our package through:\n\nMore > Test Package in the Build panel\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + T\ndevtools::test()\n\n\nFailure (test-process-data.R:8:3): grouping works\nunique(group_age(data)$Age) (`actual`) not equal to c(\"Young\", \"Middle\", \"Elderly\") (`expected`).\n\n`actual`:   \"Middle\" \"Young\"  \"Elderly\"\n`expected`: \"Young\"  \"Middle\" \"Elderly\"\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n══ Results ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nDuration: 0.2 s\n\n[ FAIL 1 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 1 ]\nInteresting… There’s a weird character order Failure. In this case, let’s just mirror what the actual is as in the expected.\n\ndata <- readr::read_csv(system.file(\"testdata\",\n                                    \"diabetes.csv\",\n                                    package = \"rrcompendium\"))\n\ntest_that(\"grouping works\", {\n  expect_equal(unique(group_age(data)$Age),\n               c(\"Middle\", \"Young\", \"Elderly\"))\n})\n\ntest_that(\"data dims preserved\", {\n  expect_equal(dim(group_age(data)),\n               dim(data))\n})\n\n══ Results ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nDuration: 0.1 s\n\n[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 2 ]\n\nOur tests pass!!\n🎉 Now every time you check your package, the test will also be run automatically.\n\n\n\nA final renv::snapshot()!\n\nrenv::snapshot()\n\nLet’s commit our work to GitHub and move on."
